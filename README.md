# 🧳 Google Form → Trip Report Generator

This Google Apps Script project automatically generates monthly trip report documents from Google Form submissions. When a form is submitted, the script:

1. Copies a Google Docs template
2. Replaces placeholders with form data
3. Saves the new report into a monthly folder on Google Drive
4. Writes the link to the document back into the linked Google Sheet

## 📋 What You’ll Need

1. **A Google Form** collecting trip report fields
2. **A linked Google Sheet** to receive form submissions
3. **A Google Docs template** with placeholders like `{{Customer}}`
4. **A "Trip Reports" folder** in Google Drive to store documents

## 🔁 Add a Trigger

1. In Apps Script, click the **Triggers** icon (clock).
2. Click **+ Add Trigger**.
3. Set:
   - Function: `autoFillTripReport`
   - Event Source: **From form**
   - Event Type: **On form submit**
4. Save and authorize the script.

## ✅ What Happens After Submission

- The form submission triggers the script.
- A Google Doc is created in a folder like `Trip Reports/2025-07/`
- Placeholders are replaced with the submission content.
- A link to the created document is written into the first `Trip Report URL` column of the sheet.

---

## 🛠 Troubleshooting

- **Missing values in report?**
  - Ensure field names in the form exactly match what's in the mapping.
- **No document created?**
  - Check `Apps Script > Executions` tab for error logs.
- **Multiple `Trip Report URL` columns?**
  - Manually delete all but one. The script always writes to the first matching column.

---

## 📬 Future Ideas

- Auto-email the generated document to the submitter
- Generate AI summaries using Gemini or PaLM (optionally)
- Summarize all monthly reports into a single doc
- Sync metadata to CRM or Jira

---

## 🔒 Notes

- This script runs under the permissions of the user who owns the spreadsheet.
- Be mindful of API quotas if used heavily or in a shared environment.
