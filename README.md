# 🧳 Google Form → Trip Report Generator

This Google Apps Script project automatically generates monthly trip report documents from Google Form submissions. When a form is submitted, the script:

1. Copies a Google Docs template
2. Replaces placeholders with form data
3. Saves the new report into a monthly folder on Google Drive
4. Writes the link to the document back into the linked Google Sheet

## 📋 What You’ll Need

1. **A Google Form** collecting trip report fields
2. **A linked Google Sheet** to receive form submissions
3. **A Google Docs template** with placeholders like `{{Customer}}`
4. **A "Trip Reports" folder** in Google Drive to store documents

## 📁 Folder & File Setup


### 🔍 How to Find Your IDs

- **Template Doc ID**:  
  Open your Google Docs template in the browser. The URL will look like this:  
  `https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ABC1234567yourDocIDgoeshere/edit`  
  The part between `/d/` and `/edit` is your **Template Doc ID**.

- **Root Folder ID**:  
  Open the destination folder in Google Drive. The URL will look like this:  
  `https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1XYZ123folderIDgoeshere`  
  The part after `/folders/` is your **Root Folder ID**.


| Resource | Value |
|---------|-------|
| **Template Doc ID** | `<YOUR_TEMPLATE_DOC_ID>` |
| **Root Drive Folder ID** | `<YOUR_ROOT_FOLDER_ID>` |
| **Response Sheet Name** | `Form Responses 1` (default when linking a form) |

## 🧠 How to Install the Script

2. Go to `Extensions → Apps Script`.
3. Paste the complete script provided.
4. Replace the two constants at the top of the script:

## 🔁 Add a Trigger

1. In Apps Script, click the **Triggers** icon (clock).
2. Click **+ Add Trigger**.
3. Set:
   - Function: `autoFillTripReport`
   - Event Source: **From form**
   - Event Type: **On form submit**
4. Save and authorize the script.

---

## ✅ What Happens After Submission

- The form submission triggers the script.
- A Google Doc is created in a folder like `Trip Reports/2025-07/`
- Placeholders are replaced with the submission content.
- A link to the created document is written into the first `Trip Report URL` column of the sheet.

---

## 🛠 Troubleshooting

- **Missing values in report?**
  - Ensure field names in the form exactly match what's in the mapping.
- **No document created?**
  - Check `Apps Script > Executions` tab for error logs.
- **Multiple `Trip Report URL` columns?**
  - Manually delete all but one. The script always writes to the first matching column.

---

## 📬 Future Ideas

- Auto-email the generated document to the submitter
- Generate AI summaries using Gemini or PaLM (optionally)
- Summarize all monthly reports into a single doc
- Sync metadata to CRM or Jira

---

## 🔒 Notes

- This script runs under the permissions of the user who owns the spreadsheet.
- Be mindful of API quotas if used heavily or in a shared environment.
